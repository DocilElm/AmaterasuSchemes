# Amaterasu Schemes
This repo was made with the purpose of having a list of color schemes for users to use for the library [Amaterasu](https://github.com/DocilElm/Amaterasu)

# Plans
I plan to make a feature in [Amaterasu](https://github.com/DocilElm/Amaterasu) where users can input the ColorScheme name and it'll automatically apply to their scheme so they can have customization on their own configuration gui.

# Contributing
As for contributors please follow these "Rules"
* Make a folder with your Scheme name
* Add a Readme that has information (or can be blank) about the scheme
* The Readme has to have an image showcasing the color scheme (This is required)
* Add `ColorScheme.json` inside this folder.
